## Writing Better Prompts

    ✅ "Create a test for login with OAuth via Google on mobile"
  </Card>

  <Card title="Provide Context" icon="circle-info">
    ❌ "Generate tests"

    ❌ "Create tests for signup"

    ✅ "Create 3 separate tests for signup: happy path, invalid email, and weak password"
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Iteration Techniques

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start Broad">
    Begin with a general request:
    ```
    Create tests for user authentication
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review and Refine">
    Ask the AI to adjust:
    ```
    Add steps for two-factor authentication
    Include social login scenarios
    Make the test data more specific
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Expand or Split">
    Modify scope as needed:
    ```
    Split this into separate tests for each auth method
    ```

    ```
    Expand this to cover all error scenarios
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save Template">
    Once you're happy with the format, use it as a reference:
    ```
    Create more tests like TC-0042
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Advanced Techniques

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Upload Documents" icon="file-arrow-up">
    Upload or paste requirements directly:
    ```
    Generate tests from this user story:
    [paste entire user story with acceptance criteria]
    ```

    Upload API documentation:
    ```
    Create API tests from these Swagger docs:
    [attach or paste OpenAPI spec]
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Reference Existing Tests" icon="link">
    Use existing tests as templates:
    ```
    Create tests similar to TC-0042 but for the signup flow
    ```

    ```
    Update TC-0156 to include these new requirements: [paste requirements]
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Ask for Recommendations" icon="lightbulb">
    Get suggestions:
    ```
    What edge cases should I test for file upload?
    ```

    ```
    Review my checkout tests and suggest improvements
    ```

    ```
    What tests am I missing for this feature?
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Batch Operations" icon="layer-group">
    Work with multiple tests:
    ```
    Generate a complete test suite for user management including CRUD operations
    ```

    ```
    Create tests for all error scenarios in the payment flow
    ```

    ```
    Convert these manual tests to automated test scripts
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Common Patterns

### Pattern 1: Feature-Complete Testing

```
Generate a complete test suite for [feature] including:
- Happy path scenarios
- Error handling
- Edge cases
- Performance requirements
- Accessibility checks
```

### Pattern 2: From User Stories

```
Create tests for this user story:

Title: As a [user type], I want to [action] so that [benefit]

Acceptance Criteria:
- [criterion 1]
- [criterion 2]
- [criterion 3]
```

### Pattern 3: API Testing

```
Generate API tests for [endpoint] including:
- Valid request
- Invalid parameters
- Authentication failures
- Rate limiting
- Response validation
```

### Pattern 4: Regression Suite

```
Create regression tests for [feature] covering:
- Previously reported bugs
- Recent changes
- Integration points
- Critical workflows
```

## Quality Checklist

Before saving AI-generated tests, verify:

<Check>Title clearly describes what is being tested</Check>
<Check>Steps are specific and actionable</Check>
<Check>Expected results are measurable</Check>
<Check>Preconditions are listed</Check>
<Check>Test data is appropriate</Check>
<Check>Tags and priority are correct</Check>
<Check>Test is atomic (tests one thing)</Check>
<Check>No assumptions about system state</Check>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="AI doesn't understand my request">
    **Try:**
    - Rephrase your question
    - Provide more context
    - Give an example of what you want
    - Break complex requests into smaller parts
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Generated tests are too generic">
    **Try:**
    - Include specific test data
    - Mention your product/industry
    - Reference existing tests as templates
    - Provide acceptance criteria or requirements
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Tests don't match my format">
    **Try:**
    - Show an example of your preferred format
    - Specify which fields to include
    - Ask for specific sections to be expanded
    - Request step-by-step refinements
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Need more edge cases">
    **Try:**
    ```
    What edge cases am I missing for [feature]?
    ```

    ```
    Generate negative test scenarios for [feature]
    ```

    ```
    What error conditions should I test?
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Pro Tips

<Tip>
**Save Good Prompts:** When you craft a prompt that works well, save it for future use
</Tip>

<Tip>
**Use Templates:** Once you have a test format you like, ask the AI to create more tests using the same structure
</Tip>

<Tip>
**Iterate in Conversation:** Don't try to get perfect results in one prompt—refine through conversation
</Tip>

<Tip>
**Combine with OQL:** Use the AI to help build complex OQL queries for advanced searches
</Tip>
