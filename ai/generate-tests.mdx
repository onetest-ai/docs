The AI Assistant can generate complete, detailed test cases in seconds. Just describe what you want to test, and the AI creates a fully-formed test case with steps, expected results, and tags.

## Quick Start

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the AI Chat">
    Press `Cmd + K` (Mac) or `Ctrl + K` (Windows/Linux)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Describe What to Test">
    Type your request in plain English:
    ```
    Create a test for user login with valid credentials
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review the Generated Test">
    The AI will create a complete test case with:
    - Clear title
    - Test steps with expected results
    - Preconditions
    - Tags
    - Priority
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save or Refine">
    - Click **"Save"** to add it to your test suite
    - Or ask the AI to modify it: "Add a step for two-factor authentication"
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Generation Patterns

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Single Test">
    **Create one specific test:**

    ```
    Create a test for password reset
    ```

    ```
    Generate a test case for adding items to cart
    ```

    ```
    Write a test for user profile update
    ```

    The AI will generate a single, focused test case.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Multiple Tests">
    **Create a suite of related tests:**

    ```
    Generate smoke tests for the checkout flow
    ```

    ```
    Create regression tests for user authentication
    ```

    ```
    Generate API tests for the products endpoint
    ```

    The AI will create multiple test cases covering different scenarios.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="From Requirements">
    **Generate from user stories or requirements:**

    ```
    Create tests for this user story:

    As a user, I want to filter products by price range
    so that I can find items within my budget.
    ```

    The AI will analyze the requirement and generate appropriate tests.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="From Documentation">
    **Generate from API docs or specifications:**

    ```
    Generate API tests from these docs:

    POST /api/users
    Creates a new user account

    Request Body:
    - email (required): string
    - password (required): string (min 8 chars)
    - name (optional): string

    Response: 201 Created
    ```

    The AI will create tests covering all scenarios and edge cases.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Refining Generated Tests

You can iterate with the AI to refine tests:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Ask for Modifications">
    ```
    Add a step to verify email notification is sent
    ```

    ```
    Make this test cover mobile view as well
    ```

    ```
    Split this into separate positive and negative tests
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Request Different Formats">
    ```
    Make this more detailed with specific test data
    ```

    ```
    Simplify this test to just the happy path
    ```

    ```
    Convert this to an API test
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Context">
    ```
    This is for a healthcare app, add HIPAA compliance checks
    ```

    ```
    We use Stripe for payments, update the payment steps
    ```

    ```
    Include accessibility testing requirements
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Advanced Techniques

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Batch Generation">
    Generate many tests at once:

    ```
    Create a complete test suite for the shopping cart feature including:
    - Adding items
    - Updating quantities
    - Removing items
    - Cart persistence
    - Checkout initiation
    ```

    The AI will create 10-15 related tests covering all aspects.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="From Screenshots">
    Upload UI screenshots:

    ```
    Generate tests for this login screen [attach screenshot]
    ```

    The AI analyzes the UI and creates appropriate tests.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Test Variations">
    Generate test variations:

    ```
    Create the same login test but for:
    - Desktop web
    - Mobile web
    - iOS app
    - Android app
    ```

    The AI creates platform-specific test cases.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Edge Cases">
    Focus on edge cases:

    ```
    What edge cases should I test for file upload?
    ```

    The AI suggests and can generate tests for:
    - Empty file
    - File too large
    - Invalid file type
    - Special characters in filename
    - Network interruption
    - Concurrent uploads
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Quality Assurance

<Note>
**Review AI Output:** Always review generated tests to ensure they match your specific requirements and context.
</Note>

<Tip>
**Provide Feedback:** Tell the AI what to adjust: "Make step 3 more specific" or "Add assertions for response time"
</Tip>

<Warning>
**Test Data:** Be cautious with sensitive data. The AI generates sample data, but you should use appropriate test data for your environment.
</Warning>

## Best Practices

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Be Specific" icon="crosshairs">
    Instead of "create a login test," try "create a test for login with OAuth via Google"
  </Card>

  <Card title="Provide Context" icon="circle-info">
    Mention the feature, platform, or user story: "Create a test for the new multi-factor authentication feature on mobile"
  </Card>

  <Card title="Iterate" icon="arrows-rotate">
    Refine the test through conversation: "Add error handling scenarios" or "Include performance assertions"
  </Card>

  <Card title="Save Templates" icon="bookmark">
    Once you get a good test format, save it as a template for consistency
