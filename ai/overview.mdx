## Common Use Cases

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Generate Tests">
    **Create a single test:**
    ```
    Create a test for login with valid credentials
    ```

    **Create multiple tests:**
    ```
    Generate smoke tests for the checkout flow
    ```

    **From requirements:**
    ```
    Create tests for this user story: [paste story]
    ```

    **From documentation:**
    ```
    Generate tests from these API docs: [paste or upload]
    ```

    <Tip>
    The AI generates complete tests with:
    - Clear titles
    - Step-by-step instructions
    - Expected results
    - Preconditions
    - Tags
    </Tip>
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Search Tests">

## Example Conversations

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Creating a Login Test" icon="user-lock">
    **You:** Create a test for login with valid credentials

    **AI:** I'll create a comprehensive login test for you.

    **Generated Test:**
    ```
    TC-0042: Verify successful login with valid credentials

    Type: Manual
    Priority: P2
    Tags: smoke, login, authentication

    Preconditions:
    - User has a valid account in the system
    - User is not currently logged in
    - Login page is accessible

    Test Steps:
    1. Navigate to the login page
       Expected: Login form displays with username and password fields

    2. Enter valid username: test@example.com
       Expected: Username field accepts input

    3. Enter valid password
       Expected: Password is masked (•••)

    4. Click "Login" button
       Expected: User redirected to dashboard within 2 seconds

    5. Verify user session
       Expected: User name displayed in header: "Welcome, Test User"

    Pass Criteria:
    - Login succeeds without errors
    - Dashboard loads within 2 seconds
    - Session is created and persists
    ```

    **AI:** Would you like me to create additional test cases for invalid credentials or edge cases?
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Finding Failed Tests" icon="triangle-exclamation">
    **You:** Show me tests that failed in the last production run

    **AI:** I found 3 tests that failed in the most recent production run:

    1. **TC-0156: Checkout with saved payment method**
       - Failed at: Step 4 (Payment processing)
       - Error: Payment gateway timeout
       - Last passed: 2 days ago

    2. **TC-0089: User profile update**
       - Failed at: Step 3 (Save changes)
       - Error: 500 Internal Server Error
       - Last passed: 1 week ago

    3. **TC-0234: Search with special characters**
       - Failed at: Step 2 (Execute search)
       - Error: Invalid query format
       - First failure

    Would you like me to:
    - Create bug reports for these failures?
    - Show the full test execution details?
    - Compare with staging results?
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Analyzing Test Coverage" icon="chart-pie">
    **You:** Do we have enough smoke tests for the authentication feature?

    **AI:** Let me analyze your authentication test coverage:

    **Current Coverage:**
    - ✅ Login with valid credentials (TC-0042)
    - ✅ Logout (TC-0043)
    - ✅ Session timeout (TC-0198)
    - ⚠️ Login with invalid credentials (missing)
    - ⚠️ Password reset flow (TC-0167 exists but not tagged 'smoke')
    - ⚠️ "Remember me" functionality (missing)
    - ⚠️ Account lockout after failed attempts (missing)

    **Recommendation:**
    You have 3 smoke tests for authentication, but I recommend adding 4 more to cover critical failure scenarios and security features.

    Would you like me to:
    1. Generate the missing smoke tests?
    2. Update TC-0167 to include 'smoke' tag?
    3. Create a complete authentication test suite?
