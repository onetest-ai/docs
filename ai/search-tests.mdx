Use natural language to search your test suite. The AI translates your questions into precise OQL queries automatically.

## Quick Examples

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="By Status">
    ```
    Show me all failed tests from yesterday
    ```
  </Card>

  <Card title="By Feature">
    ```
    Find all smoke tests for login
    ```
  </Card>

  <Card title="By Priority">
    ```
    List all P0 tests that haven't run yet
    ```
  </Card>

  <Card title="Complex Queries">
    ```
    Show P1 tests that failed in staging but passed in dev
    ```
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Ask in Plain English">
    Type your search as a question or statement:
    ```
    Which tests haven't been run in the last 30 days?
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="AI Translates to OQL">
    The AI converts your query to OneTest Query Language:
    ```oql
    last_run < -30d ORDER BY title
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Get Results">
    See matching tests with relevant details highlighted
  </Step>

  <Step title="Refine Search">
    Ask follow-up questions to narrow down results
  </Step>
</Steps>
