  <Step title="Create New Product">
    Click **"+ New Product"** in the top navigation
  </Step>

  <Step title="Fill in Details">
    Enter the following information:
    - **Name:** `My First App`

</Frame>

<Note>
You can create multiple products for different applications or teams.
</Note>

## Step 2: Create Your First Test Case

Now let's create a simple test case. We'll use the AI Assistant to make it quick!

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Using AI (Recommended)">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Open AI Chat">
        Press `Cmd/Ctrl + K` to open the chat
      </Step>

      <Step title="Ask AI to Create Test">
        Type:
        ```
        Create a test for login with valid credentials
        ```
      </Step>

      <Step title="Review Generated Test">
        Watch the AI create your test automatically
      </Step>

      <Step title="Save">
        Click **"Save"** when you're happy with it
      </Step>
    </Steps>

    **Example AI Output:**

    ```markdown
    ✅ Created TC-0001: Verify successful login with valid credentials

</Frame>

<Note>
Your test case is automatically assigned a unique identifier (e.g., TC-0001) and is now ready to be executed!
</Note>

## Step 3: Run Your First Test

Now let's execute the test case you just created.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Test Management">
    Navigate to the **Test Management** page
  </Step>

  <Step title="Find Your Test">
    Locate your test case (TC-0001)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Start Run">
    Click the **"▶ Run"** button
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Run">
    In the dialog, enter:
    - **Run Name:** `First Test Run - Staging`
    - **Environment:** Select `Staging` (or create one)
    - **Build:** Select a build or leave empty
  </Step>

  <Step title="Execute">
    Click **"Start Run"**
  </Step>
</Steps>

  <img src="/gifs/create_test_run.gif" alt="Create Test Run" style={{ maxWidth: '800px', width: '100%', height: 'auto' }} />
</Frame>

## Step 4: Execute and Record Results

OneTest will take you to the **Test Execution** page where you can record your results as you test.

### Recording Results

For each test step:

1. **Perform the action** (e.g., navigate to login page)
2. **Observe the result**
3. **Click the status:**
   - ✅ **Pass** - Everything works as expected
   - ❌ **Fail** - Something doesn't match the expected result
   - ⏭️ **Skip** - Step wasn't executed
   - 🚫 **Blocked** - Can't proceed due to an issue
4. Add notes if needed (especially for failures!)

### Example Execution

```markdown
Step 1: Navigate to login page
Status: ✅ Pass
Notes: Login form loaded correctly

Step 2: Enter valid username
Status: ✅ Pass

Step 3: Enter valid password
Status: ✅ Pass
Notes: Password was properly masked

Step 4: Click Login button
Status: ❌ Fail
Notes: Got error "Server timeout" - dashboard didn't load

Step 5: Verify user name
Status: 🚫 Blocked
Notes: Could not complete due to step 4 failure
```

When done, click **"Complete Execution"**.

## Step 5: View Your Results

After completing the test run, you'll see a summary:

### Run Summary

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Total Tests** | 1 |
| **Passed** | 0 |
| **Failed** | 1 |
| **Blocked** | 0 |
| **Pass Rate** | 0% |
| **Duration** | 8 minutes |

## Common Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How many test cases can I create?">
    Unlimited! Create as many as you need to properly test your application.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I automate test execution?">
    Manual tests record human execution. For automation, integrate with tools like Selenium or Playwright (coming soon).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I import existing tests?">
    Yes! Use the AI to convert existing test documentation:

    ```
    Create tests from this document: [paste your test doc]
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I organize many tests?">
    Use **folders** for hierarchy and **tags** for cross-cutting concerns:
    - Folders: By feature (Login, Checkout, Profile)
    - Tags: By type (smoke, regression, api)
