    Group tests with:
    - **Folders** - By feature (Login, Checkout, Settings)
    - **Tags** - By type (smoke, regression, api)
    - **Suites** - For specific runs (Nightly, Pre-deploy)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Run Tests">
    1. Select tests or a suite
    2. Choose environment (Staging, Production)
    3. Click "Run"
    4. Track progress in real-time
  </Step>

  <Step title="Track Results">
    Monitor key metrics:
    - ✅ **Pass Rate** - What percentage passed?
    - ⏱️ **Duration** - How long did it take?
    - 📊 **Trends** - Is quality improving?
    - 🐛 **Failures** - What broke?
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Key Concepts

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Test Cases" icon="file-lines">
    A test case describes **what** to test and **how** to test it.

    **Example:**
    ```
    Title: User can reset password via email

    Steps:
    1. Click "Forgot Password"
    2. Enter email address
    3. Click "Send Reset Link"
    4. Check email inbox
    5. Click reset link
    6. Enter new password
    7. Log in with new password

    Expected: User successfully resets password and can log in
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Test Runs" icon="play">
    A test run is an **execution** of test cases against a specific build or environment.

    **Example:**
    ```
    Run Name: Staging Smoke Tests - Build 245
    Environment: Staging
    Tests: 25 smoke tests
    Status: 24 passed, 1 failed
    Duration: 15 minutes
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Test Suites" icon="layer-group">
    A suite is a **collection** of related tests that run together.

    **Common Suites:**
    - **Smoke** - Critical paths (5-15 tests, 15 mins)
    - **Regression** - Full coverage (100+ tests, 2+ hours)
    - **Feature** - Specific feature tests
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Tags" icon="tags">
    Labels to categorize tests across folders.

    **Common Tags:**
    ```
    smoke, regression, api, ui, mobile,
    critical, high-priority, automated
    ```
  </Accordion>
