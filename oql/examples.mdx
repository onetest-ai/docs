## Tips for Writing Queries

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Start Simple" icon="seedling">
    Begin with one condition and add more:
    ```oql
    status = active
    → status = active AND priority = p1
    → status = active AND priority = p1 AND tags CONTAINS "smoke"
    ```
  </Card>

  <Card title="Use Parentheses" icon="brackets">
    Make complex logic clear:
    ```oql
    (A OR B) AND (C OR D)
    ```
  </Card>

  <Card title="Order Matters" icon="sort">
    Put most selective conditions first for better performance:
    ```oql
    priority = p0 AND status = active  # Better
    status = active AND priority = p0  # Still works, but less optimal
    ```
  </Card>

  <Card title="Save Frequent Queries" icon="bookmark">
    Save complex queries for reuse instead of rewriting them
