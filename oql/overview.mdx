**OQL (OneTest Query Language)** is a simple, powerful way to search and filter tests. It's inspired by JQL (Jira Query Language) and designed to feel natural while giving you precise control.

## Why Use OQL?

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Precise Control" icon="crosshairs">
    Filter by exact criteria, not fuzzy matches
  </Card>

  <Card title="Save Queries" icon="bookmark">
    Save complex searches for reuse
  </Card>

  <Card title="Combine Conditions" icon="layer-group">
    Use AND, OR, NOT for complex filters
  </Card>

## Quick Examples

<CodeGroup>

```oql Simple Filter
status = active
```

```oql Multiple Conditions
status = active AND priority IN (p1, p2)
```

```oql Pattern Matching
title ~ "login" AND scope ^ "auth"
```

```oql Date Queries
created_at >= -7d ORDER BY created_at DESC
```

```oql Arrays
tags CONTAINS "smoke" AND tags NOT CONTAINS "deprecated"
```

</CodeGroup>

## Basic Syntax

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Comparisons">
    Compare fields to values:

    | Operator | Meaning | Example |
    |----------|---------|---------|
    | `=` | Equals | `status = active` |
    | `!=` | Not equals | `priority != p4` |
    | `>` | Greater than | `created_at > 2024-01-01` |
    | `>=` | Greater or equal | `version >= 2.0` |
    | `<` | Less than | `priority < p2` |
    | `<=` | Less or equal | `updated_at <= -7d` |
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Pattern Matching">
    Match text patterns:

    | Operator | Meaning | Example |
    |----------|---------|---------|
    | `~` | Contains | `title ~ "login"` |
    | `^ ` | Starts with | `identifier ^ "TC-10"` |
    | `$` | Ends with | `title $ "test"` |
    | `!~` | Not contains | `description !~ "deprecated"` |
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Arrays">
    Work with lists:

    | Operator | Meaning | Example |
    |----------|---------|---------|
    | `IN` | Value in list | `priority IN (p1, p2)` |
    | `NOT IN` | Value not in list | `status NOT IN (archived, deleted)` |
    | `CONTAINS` | Array contains value | `tags CONTAINS "smoke"` |
    | `CONTAINS ANY` | Array contains any value | `tags CONTAINS ANY (smoke, regression)` |
    | `CONTAINS ALL` | Array contains all values | `tags CONTAINS ALL (smoke, critical)` |
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Logic">
    Combine conditions:

    | Operator | Meaning | Example |
    |----------|---------|---------|
    | `AND` | Both conditions | `status = active AND priority = p1` |
    | `OR` | Either condition | `priority = p1 OR priority = p2` |
    | `NOT` | Negate condition | `NOT status = archived` |
    | `( )` | Group conditions | `(status = active OR status = approved) AND priority = p1` |
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Common Queries

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Find Failed Tests" icon="triangle-exclamation">
    ```oql
    status = failed AND last_run >= -7d
    ```

    Find tests that failed in the last 7 days.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Smoke Tests" icon="fire">
    ```oql
    tags CONTAINS "smoke" AND status = active
    ORDER BY priority
    ```

    All active smoke tests, ordered by priority.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="High Priority Tests" icon="exclamation">
    ```oql
    priority IN (p0, p1) AND status != archived
    ORDER BY created_at DESC
    ```

    All P0 and P1 tests that aren't archived.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Recently Updated" icon="clock">
    ```oql
    updated_at >= -14d
    ORDER BY updated_at DESC
    LIMIT 50
    ```

    Tests updated in the last 2 weeks.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Never Run" icon="circle-xmark">
    ```oql
    last_run IS NULL AND status = active
    ```

    Active tests that have never been executed.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Specific Feature" icon="folder">
    ```oql
    folder_path ~ "/authentication/" AND
    (tags CONTAINS "smoke" OR priority = p1)
    ```

    Important authentication tests.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Date & Time Queries

OQL supports flexible date queries:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Relative Dates">
    ```oql
    created_at >= -7d        # Last 7 days
    created_at >= -2w        # Last 2 weeks
    created_at >= -3M        # Last 3 months
    created_at >= -1y        # Last year
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Specific Dates">
    ```oql
    created_at >= 2024-01-01
    created_at BETWEEN 2024-01-01 AND 2024-12-31
    updated_at = 2024-06-15
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Date Functions">
    ```oql
    created_at >= startOfWeek()
    created_at >= startOfMonth()
    created_at >= startOfYear()
    created_at <= endOfMonth()
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Time Comparisons">
    ```oql
    updated_at > created_at
    last_run >= updated_at
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Sorting & Pagination

Control result order and size:

```oql
# Sort by single field
ORDER BY created_at DESC

# Sort by multiple fields
ORDER BY priority ASC, created_at DESC

# Limit results
LIMIT 50

# Pagination
LIMIT 50 OFFSET 100
```

    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save with Name">

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Using with AI

<Tip>
You don't need to write OQL manually! Just ask the AI:

```
Show me high priority tests that failed recently
```

The AI translates to:
```oql
priority IN (p0, p1) AND status = failed AND last_run >= -7d
```
</Tip>
