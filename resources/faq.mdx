  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## AI Assistant

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How does the AI Assistant work?" icon="robot">
    The AI Assistant uses Claude (by Anthropic) to understand your testing needs and generate complete test cases.

    **It can:**
    - Generate single tests or entire test suites
    - Search existing tests using natural language
    - Answer questions about your product
    - Suggest test improvements
    - Extract test cases from requirements

    **It understands context:**
    - Knows which product you're working on
    - Sees your current page and selections
    - Learns from your existing tests
    - Adapts to your testing style
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Is my data used to train AI models?" icon="shield-halved">
    **No.** OneTest uses Claude's API with strict data protections:

    - Your data is never used for training
    - Conversations are encrypted
    - Data stays in your region
    - You control data retention

    See our [Privacy Policy](https://onetest.ai/privacy) for details.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I customize AI behavior?" icon="sliders">
    **Yes!** You can customize:

    - **Personality**: Technical, friendly, concise, etc.
    - **Detail level**: Brief or comprehensive test cases
    - **Naming style**: Your preferred test naming conventions
    - **Prompt templates**: Save prompts for common scenarios

    Go to **Settings** → **AI Preferences** to customize.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What if the AI generates incorrect tests?" icon="triangle-exclamation">
    The AI is very capable but not perfect:

    **Always review generated tests:**
    - Check steps make sense
    - Verify expected results
    - Add missing details
    - Adjust to your standards

    **Improve AI output:**
    - Be specific in your prompts
    - Provide more context
    - Use examples
    - Give feedback on generated tests

    The AI learns from your edits and improves over time.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## OQL Query Language

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is OQL?" icon="magnifying-glass">
    **OQL (OneTest Query Language)** is a simple but powerful query language for finding tests, similar to JQL in JIRA.

    **Example:**
    ```oql
    status = active AND priority IN (p0, p1) AND
    tags CONTAINS "smoke"
    ORDER BY created_at DESC
    ```

    See [OQL Overview](/oql/overview) for details.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Do I need to learn OQL?" icon="graduation-cap">
    **Not required, but recommended** for power users:

    - **Basic users**: Use simple filters in the UI
    - **Advanced users**: Learn OQL for complex queries
    - **AI users**: Ask AI to write OQL for you!

    **Example with AI:**
    ```
    "Show me high priority tests that failed last week"
    ```
    AI generates: `priority IN (p0, p1) AND status = failed AND last_run >= -7d`
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I save queries?" icon="bookmark">
    **Yes!** Save frequently-used queries:

    1. Write your OQL query
    2. Click **"Save Query"**
    3. Give it a name (e.g., "Critical Failed Tests")
    4. Access from "Saved Queries" dropdown

    Saved queries are shared with your team.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Test Execution

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How do I run tests?" icon="play">
    **Three ways to run tests:**

    1. **Individual test**: Open test → Click "Run Test"
    2. **Test run**: Select multiple tests → Click "Create Run"
    3. **Automated**: Schedule tests or trigger from CI/CD

    See [Running Tests](/ui/running-tests) for details.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can tests be automated?" icon="robot">
    **Yes!** OneTest supports:
    - Manual test execution (click through UI)
    - Automated test execution (API/Selenium/Playwright)
    - Hybrid approach (some manual, some automated)

    **For automation:**
    - Mark tests as "automated"
    - Link to automation test ID
    - Execute via API
    - Track automated results
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I attach screenshots to test results?" icon="image">
    **During test execution:**
    1. Execute a test step
    2. Click **"Add Evidence"**
    3. Upload screenshot or drag & drop
    4. Add optional description
    5. Continue with next step

    **Supported formats:** PNG, JPEG, GIF, PDF
    **Storage:** Stored in Artifacts service
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I run tests in parallel?" icon="arrows-split-up-and-left">
    **Yes!** Distribute tests across team members:

    1. Create a test run
    2. Assign different tests to different team members
    3. Everyone executes their assigned tests simultaneously
    4. Monitor progress on run dashboard

    This significantly speeds up test execution.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Tests are running slowly" icon="hourglass">
    **Possible causes:**
    - Too many steps per test
    - Complex test data setup
    - Slow environment
    - Network issues

    **Solutions:**
    - Break large tests into smaller tests
    - Optimize test data
    - Use faster environment
    - Check network connectivity
    - Consider automation for repetitive tests
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can't find my tests" icon="magnifying-glass">
    **Try these:**
    1. Check filters—clear all filters and try again
    2. Check folder—tests might be in subfolder
    3. Check status—test might be archived
    4. Use OQL: `title ~ "your search term"`
    5. Use AI: "Find tests related to login"
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="AI Assistant is not responding" icon="circle-exclamation">
    **Check:**
    1. Internet connection
    2. Browser console for errors
    3. Try refreshing the page
    4. Check system status page

    If problem persists, contact support.
