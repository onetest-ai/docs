OneTest uses a **coin-based** metering system to track API usage. Every API call made through an API key costs coins, while browser-based (UI) usage is always free.

## How Metering Works

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Free: Browser Usage" icon="desktop">
    All actions through the OneTest UI are **free** and never consume coins. This includes using the AI assistant, managing tests, and viewing results.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Metered: API Keys" icon="key">
    Programmatic access via API keys is metered. Each API call costs coins based on the operation type.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Coin Pricing

Every product starts with a **weekly budget of 1,000 coins** that resets automatically each week.

| Operation | Cost | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| REST API call | 1 coin | Any API call authenticated with an API key |
| MCP single action | 1 coin | Single tool invocation via MCP |
| Agent loop | 1 coin per 10 steps | AI agent operations (batched) |
| Test ingestion | 1 coin | ReportPortal agent submissions |
| JUnit import | 1 coin | JUnit XML file imports |
| UI operation | Free | All browser-based actions |

<Note>
Pricing is per API call, not per data volume. A single API call that returns 100 test cases costs the same as one that returns 1.
</Note>

## Viewing Usage

Navigate to **Settings** > **Usage & Billing** to see your current usage.

### Activity Log

The activity log shows every metered event in real-time:

- **User** who made the request
- **Operation type** (REST API, MCP action, etc.)
- **Service** that handled the request
- **Coin cost** for each event
- **Timestamp** of the event

Use the date filters to narrow down activity to a specific period.

### Usage Summary

The summary panel shows at a glance:

- **Coins used** this billing cycle
- **Coins remaining** in your weekly budget
- **Budget cycle dates** (start and end)
- **Usage breakdown** by operation type

### Usage Breakdown

See which types of operations consume the most coins:

```
REST API calls:     450 coins (45%)
MCP actions:        300 coins (30%)
Test ingestion:     150 coins (15%)
JUnit imports:      100 coins (10%)
```

### Export Activity

Export your activity log as CSV for reporting:

1. Go to **Settings** > **Usage & Billing**
2. Set the date range (up to 3 months)
3. Click **Export CSV**

The export includes: timestamp, user, event type, source, service, operation, and coin cost.

## Managing Budgets

### Weekly Budget

Each product has a configurable weekly coin budget:

- **Default:** 1,000 coins per week
- **Minimum:** No minimum
- **Maximum:** No limit

The budget resets automatically at the start of each weekly cycle.

### Overage Protection

By default, API requests are **blocked** when the budget is exhausted. You can change this behavior:

- **Block on exhaustion** (default): API calls return `429 Too Many Requests` when coins run out
- **Allow overage**: API calls continue working beyond the budget limit

### Hourly Rate Limit

Set a maximum number of requests per hour to prevent runaway scripts or misconfigured integrations:

- **Default:** Unlimited (0)
- **Configurable:** 1 to 10,000 requests per hour

### Adjusting Settings

To change budget settings:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Settings">
    Navigate to **Settings** > **Usage & Billing**
  </Step>

  <Step title="Edit Budget">
    Adjust the weekly coin budget, overage policy, and hourly rate limit
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save Changes">
    Click **Save** to apply the new settings
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Budget Top-Up

If you run out of coins mid-cycle, you can add more:

1. Go to **Settings** > **Usage & Billing**
2. Click **Top Up**
3. Enter the number of coins to add
4. Coins are added immediately to your available balance

<Tip>
Top-up coins are added to the current cycle only. They don't carry over or change your weekly budget.
</Tip>

## Usage History

View historical usage by week to identify trends:

- **Weekly snapshots** showing total coins used and event counts
- **Breakdown by operation type** for each week
- **Up to 12 weeks** of history

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What happens when I run out of coins?" icon="circle-exclamation">
    By default, API requests return `429 Too Many Requests`. UI access is never affected. You can either:
    - Wait for the weekly reset
    - Top up coins manually
    - Enable overage to allow continued access
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Does the AI assistant cost coins?" icon="sparkles">
    **No.** The AI assistant is accessed through the browser UI, which is always free. Only programmatic API access via API keys is metered.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="When does the weekly budget reset?" icon="clock">
    The budget resets automatically 7 days after the cycle start date. The exact dates are shown on the Usage & Billing page.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I see who is using the most coins?" icon="users">
    Yes. The activity log shows which user made each request. Export to CSV and sort by user to see per-user consumption.
