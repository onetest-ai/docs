## Filtering & Sorting Results

Use powerful filters to find what matters:

<CodeGroup>
```oql Find Recent Failures
status = failed AND execution_date >= -7d
ORDER BY execution_date DESC
```

```oql Flaky Tests
pass_rate < 0.8 AND pass_rate > 0 AND execution_count >= 5
ORDER BY pass_rate ASC
```

```oql Slow Tests
avg_duration > 300
ORDER BY avg_duration DESC
```

```oql Untested High Priority
status = active AND priority IN (p0, p1) AND last_run IS NULL
ORDER BY priority ASC
```
</CodeGroup>

    GET /api/v1/executions/{execution_id}

    # Query results with OQL
    POST /api/v1/products/{id}/search/executions
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Understanding Metrics

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Pass Rate" icon="percent">
    **Formula:** `(Passed Tests / Total Tests) × 100`

    **Interpretation:**
    - **≥95%**: Excellent quality
    - **90-94%**: Good quality
    - **80-89%**: Needs attention
    - **&lt;80%**: Critical issues

    <Tip>
    Track pass rate trends, not just absolute values. A declining trend indicates growing technical debt.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Flaky Tests" icon="shuffle">
    Tests that pass sometimes and fail other times without code changes.

    **Detection:** Tests with:
    - Pass rate between 20% and 80%
    - At least 5 executions
    - No pattern to failures

    **Action:** Fix or remove flaky tests—they erode confidence in your test suite.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Test Velocity" icon="gauge">
    **Formula:** `Tests Executed / Time Period`

    Measures how quickly you're validating changes. Higher velocity means faster feedback loops.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Coverage" icon="chart-pie">
    Percentage of features/requirements that have associated tests.

    **Types:**
    - **Feature coverage**: Features with tests
    - **Requirement coverage**: Requirements with tests
    - **Priority coverage**: P0/P1 features with tests
    - **Execution coverage**: Tests run in last N days
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
