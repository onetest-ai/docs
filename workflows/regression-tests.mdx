## What is Regression Testing?

Regression testing ensures that new code changes haven't broken existing functionality. It's typically run before releases or after significant code changes.

<Tip>
While smoke tests verify "can we continue testing?", regression tests verify "are we ready to ship?"
</Tip>

## Building a Regression Suite

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start with Critical Tests">
    Include all smoke tests (P0/P1 critical paths)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Feature Coverage">
    Include tests for all major features:
    ```oql
    priority IN (p0, p1, p2) AND status = active
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Historical Failures">
    Include tests that have failed before:
    ```oql
    failure_count > 0 AND status = active
    ORDER BY failure_count DESC
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Tag Tests">
    Tag tests with `regression` for easy filtering:
    ```oql
    tags CONTAINS "regression" AND status = active
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Balance Coverage vs Time">
    Target suite that completes in 2-4 hours maximum
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Regression Testing Strategy

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Full Regression">
    ### Complete Test Suite

    Run all regression tests before major releases.

    **When to use:**
    - Major version releases
    - Quarterly releases
    - After significant architecture changes

    **Characteristics:**
    - 100+ tests
    - 2-4 hours execution time
    - All features covered
    - All priority levels (P0-P3)

    <Warning>
    Full regression is time-consuming. Reserve for major releases only.
    </Warning>
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Selective Regression">
    ### Risk-Based Testing

    Test only areas affected by recent changes.

    **When to use:**
    - Sprint releases
    - Minor version updates
    - Targeted hotfixes

    **Strategy:**
    ```oql
    # Tests in affected components
    component IN (authentication, checkout) AND
    tags CONTAINS "regression" AND
    status = active
    ```

    **Benefits:**
    - Faster execution (30-60 minutes)
    - Focused on risk areas
    - More frequent testing possible
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Automated Regression">
    ### Continuous Regression

    Automated tests run on every commit or nightly.

    **Setup:**
    - Automate all P0/P1 tests
    - Run on CI/CD pipeline
    - Integrate with version control
    - Alert team on failures

    **Benefits:**
    - Catch regressions early
    - Fast feedback loop
    - No manual effort required
    - Consistent execution
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Running Regression Tests

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select Test Suite">
    Choose appropriate regression level:

    ```oql
    # Full regression
    tags CONTAINS "regression" AND status = active
    ORDER BY priority ASC

    # Selective regression (e.g., auth module)
    tags CONTAINS "regression" AND
    component = "authentication" AND
    status = active
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create Test Run">
    Configure the test run:
    - **Name**: `Regression - v2.1.0 Release`
    - **Environment**: `Staging`
    - **Build**: `2.1.0-rc1`
    - **Assigned to**: Distribute among team
  </Step>

  <Step title="Execute Tests">
    Team executes assigned tests in parallel
  </Step>

  <Step title="Track Progress">
    Monitor run dashboard for:
    - Completion percentage
    - Pass/fail rate
    - Blockers
    - Failed tests needing triage
  </Step>

  <Step title="Triage Failures">
    For each failure:
    - Is it a real bug? Create defect.
    - Is it a test issue? Fix the test.
    - Is it environmental? Investigate environment.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Release Decision">
    Decide go/no-go based on results:
    - All P0 tests passed? ✅ Can release
    - Any P0 failures? ❌ Block release
    - P1/P2 failures? Assess risk
  </Step>
</Steps>
