## Best Practices for Teams

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Clear Ownership" icon="user">
    **Why:** Prevents "bystander effect" where no one maintains tests

    **How:**
    - Assign tests to specific people or teams
    - Use custom field: `owner: "auth-team"`
    - Make ownership visible in test metadata
    - Review ownership quarterly

    ```oql
    # Find unowned tests
    status = active AND owner IS NULL
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Standardized Templates" icon="file-lines">
    **Why:** Ensures consistency across team

    **How:**
    - Create test case templates
    - Document test writing guidelines
    - Use AI prompts for consistent generation
    - Review new tests for adherence

    <Tip>
    Save common AI prompts as prompt templates for the whole team to use.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Regular Sync Meetings" icon="calendar">
    **Why:** Keeps team aligned on testing strategy

    **Agenda:**

    - Identify coverage gaps
    - Plan upcoming test work
    - Share best practices

    **Frequency:** Weekly or bi-weekly
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Shared Test Libraries" icon="book">
    **Why:** Prevents duplicate effort

    **How:**
    - Create reusable test steps
    - Share test data sets
    - Document common workflows
    - Use saved OQL queries
    - Build test case templates
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Knowledge Sharing" icon="graduation-cap">
    **Why:** Improves team capability

    **How:**
    - Document domain knowledge
    - Pair testing sessions
    - Internal testing workshops
    - Share test case examples
    - Code review for test automation
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Handling Conflicts

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Concurrent Edits" icon="code-merge">
    **Problem:** Two people edit the same test simultaneously

    **Solution:**
    - OneTest uses versioning—both edits are saved
    - Compare versions and merge manually
    - Communicate before major test updates
    - Use assignment to indicate "I'm working on this"
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Disagreements on Test Approach" icon="message">
    **Problem:** Team members have different opinions on how to test

    **Solution:**
    - Discuss in team meeting
    - Document testing standards
    - Defer to QA lead for final decision
    - Try both approaches and compare
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Test Ownership Disputes" icon="user-group">
    **Problem:** Unclear who owns certain tests

    **Solution:**
    - Default to feature team ownership
    - For cross-cutting tests, assign primary owner
    - Document ownership in test metadata
    - Review ownership during test audits
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
